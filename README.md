## About WOMBO
WOMBO is one of the world’s leading consumer AI companies, and early believers in generative AI.

We've launched - two #1 apps, [WOMBO](http://wombo.ai/) and [Dream](http://dream.ai/) which have been **downloaded over 200M times** and have **each** **hit #1 on the app stores in 100+ countries**

These results were **only possible due to the immense capabilities of bleeding edge generative AI techniques and the power of open source AI**. Our unique understanding of this research space through a consumer entertainment lens allows us to craft products people love to use and share.

We are at the very beginning of the Synthetic Media Revolution, which will completely transform how people create, consume, and distribute content. We're building the apps and infrastructure to power this change and bring AI entertainment potential to the masses.

## About w.ai

### Democratizing the Future of AI
w.ai envisions a future where artificial intelligence is decentralized, democratized, and accessible to everyone. This vision is embodied in a global supercomputer composed of individual user devices—laptops, gaming rigs, and smartphones. By harnessing the untapped potential of these devices, w.ai aims to create a vast decentralized network of computing power, democratizing access to the most advanced AI technologies. This approach will foster a thriving ecosystem of AI applications, driving innovation and ensuring the benefits of AI are shared by all of humanity.

## EdgeMaxxing Subnet

### What is the goal?
The EdgeMaxxing subnet aims to create the world's most optimized AI models for consumer devices. We've already optimized Stable Diffusion XL on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 and are now working on Flux Schnell for the same hardware.

The subnet will expand to support optimization for various end devices, models, and modalities overtime.

### Key Benefits of Optimized Models:
Optimizing AI models is crucial to realizing a vision of decentralized AI.
- **Accessibility:** Enabling these advanced models to run on consumer devices, from smartphones to laptops, bringing AI capabilities to everyone.
- **Decentralization:** Allowing millions of users to contribute their computing power, rather than relying on a small number of powerful miners, creating a truly distributed AI network.

By optimizing popular models like Flux and Stable Diffusion, we transform idle computing resources into valuable contributors to a global AI network. This democratizes both AI usage and creation, offering earning opportunities to millions.

## Miners and Validators

### Incentive Mechanism and Reward Structure

The EdgeMaxxing subnet defines specific models, pipelines, and target hardware for optimization. Miners and validators collaborate in a daily competition to improve AI model performance on consumer devices.

Miners are rewarded based on how optimized their submissions are relative to other miners and the baseline. Every day at 12 PM PST a contest is run.

Validators receive rewards for their consistent operation and accurate scoring.

### Competition Structure
1. Miners submit optimized models
2. Validators score submissions
3. Contest runs daily at 12 PM PST
4. Miners receive rewards based on their ranking

## Active Contests

- ### Flux Schnell
  - Baseline: https://github.com/womboai/flux-schnell-edge-inference
  - Hardware: `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090`
  - Focus:
      - Generation time: `14%` of final score
      - Similarity to baseline: `43%` of final score
      - VRAM Usage: `43%` of final score

## Getting Started

- ### [Miners](miner/README.md#setup)

- ### [Validators](validator/README.md#setup)

## Dashboard
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/wombo/edge-maxxing-dashboard
- Contains the following:
  - Leaderboard with all submitted models and their scores + metrics
  - A list of active validators and their benchmarking states
  - The weights set by every validator
  - A list of miner submissions
  - An interactive model demo, showcasing the results of the best models compared to the baseline

## Roadmap
Our mission is to create the world's most optimized AI models for edge devices, democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities. Here's our path forward:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Current)**
- [ ] Perfect contest and benchmarking mechanisms
- [ ] Establish a robust framework for measuring model performance across hardware
- [ ] Cultivate a community of world-class miners skilled in optimizing models for edge devices

**Phase 2: Expansion**
- [ ] Support a diverse range of AI models, pipelines, and consumer-grade hardware
- [ ] Develop tools to lower entry barriers for new participants
- [ ] Integrate initial set of optimized models into the w.ai platform

**Phase 3: Mass Adoption and Accessibility**
- [ ] Launch user-friendly mobile app for widespread participation in the network
- [ ] Implement intuitive interfaces for non-technical users to contribute and benefit from optimized AI models
- [ ] Fully integrate EdgeMaxxing with w.ai, making all optimized models instantly available and usable on the platform

**Long-term Vision**
- [ ] Transform EdgeMaxxing into a cornerstone of decentralized AI, where:
- [ ] Any device, from smartphones to high-end GPUs, can contribute to and benefit from the network
- [ ] Optimized models power a new generation of AI-driven applications
- [ ] EdgeMaxxing becomes the go-to platform for rapid benchmarking and optimization of new AI models on diverse hardware
